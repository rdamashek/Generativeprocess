# Signaling Vulnerability

You can explicitly choose (and indicate to others) the level of vulnerability with which you are comfortable - this is your “vulnerability mode.” This choice affects how you receive negative signals. To begin with there are three vulnerability modes: fragile, confident, and resilient:

-   Fragile: when you feel fragile you do not receive negative signals.
-   Confident: when you feel confident you receive negative signals within friendly relationships and only indications of negative signals from others. An indication tells you that a signal has been sent but is not available to you because of either your limited relationship with the sender or your own vulnerability mode.
-   Resilient: when you feel resilient you receive negative signals from anyone.

Like the signal vocabulary, vulnerability modes are also informed by the needs and preferences of the members of the space. They are also stewarded by the Culturizers.
