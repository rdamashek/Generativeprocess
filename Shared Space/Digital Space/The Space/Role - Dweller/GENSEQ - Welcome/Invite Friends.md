# Invite Friends

Your host asks you if you wish to invite other friends into the space with you. If you indicate that you do, the host gives you tokens that you can give to your friends. When they are admitted into the space, if they carry one of these tokens, relationship signals will be generated among you to acknowledge and signal your connections in the space.
