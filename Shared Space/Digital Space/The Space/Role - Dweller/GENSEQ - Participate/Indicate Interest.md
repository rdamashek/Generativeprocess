# Indicate Interest

When you encounter an activity that calls to you, you can indicate your interest in it. This is like bookmarking it for future reference. However, your interest also acts as a signal for others.

If other dwellers, like you, indicate an interest in an activity, that says something about its value and relevance in the space. It could be that you chose this activity because others indicated that they too are interested in it.

Your interest is also valuable to the activity Gardener and to the Culturizers. It signals that this activity is relevant and welcome in the space.
