# Socializing Before

In the time leading up to the activity, the Gardener may offer some guidance on how to prepare for the activity. You can communicate with others in your participant group, and you can send interest signals. These interest signals are initially more about personal interests and may evolve and change during and after the activity. See GENSEQ: Interest Signaling.
