# Designating Purpose

A space crystallizes and forms around a clearly stated purpose. A designated purpose helps to orient the activities and social dynamics of a space. A designated purpose announces to potential dwellers what the space is about and how it differs from other spaces. In joining the space, a new dweller is expressing implicit resonance with the designated purpose of the space.
