# Shaping Value Agreements

Value can be generated in the space in many ways. Value Agreements generate an accounting mechanism for expressing, aligning and recording value flows. (see GENSEQ: Money -> Value Agreements).

The seed crew can shape a vocabulary of value objects and templates for value agreements that help to shape value signaling and flow within the space. Templates can be shaped for value flows among and between dwellers, Gardeners, Culturizers and Sourcerers.

Value can be generated in the space in many ways. Value Agreements generate an accounting mechanism for expressing, aligning and recording value flows.

Common value-generation takes place in activities and is generated between Gardeners and Dwellers. Templates of Value Agreements can be prepared for this kind of value exchange.  

Value Agreements can also be put in place between Culturizers and Gardeners within the space. These can be used to enable sharing -flows with the Culturizers to support their work of caring for and tending to the space.  

Value Agreements can also be put in place between Sourcerers and Culturizers. These can be used to enable sharing-flows with the Sourcerers to support their work of caring for the Structure and all the spaces that it supports.
