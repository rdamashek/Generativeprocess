# Sourcerers

Sourcerers tend to the health and well-being of the structure as a whole. The Sourcerers act are the Culturizers of the initiation space. They facilitate, within the Initiation space, practices that support and nourish Seeders and established Culturizers. They also facilitate collaboration between established Culturizers and new Seeders. In doing so, they assist Seeders in preparing to shape and hold new spaces.
