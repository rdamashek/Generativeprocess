# Initiation Space

The Initiation space is a practice space like any other practice space in the structure (see GENSEQ: Dweller/A Practice Space). It is unique in that it is dedicated to the creation of new spaces and to tending to the health and well-being of existing spaces. The participants in this space are established Culturizers, Seeders and Sourcerers.
