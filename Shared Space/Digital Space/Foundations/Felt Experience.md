# Felt Experience

We acknowledge that, for now, our capacities to predict or even comprehend what works and what doesn’t are limited. We meet this challenge by returning to and reconnecting embodied felt-experience as a source of guidance. When we can’t understand what is right we seek an embodied feeling of what is right.
